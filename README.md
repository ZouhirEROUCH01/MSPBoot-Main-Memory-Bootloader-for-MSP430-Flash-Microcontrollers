# MSPBoot-Main-Memory-Bootloader-for-MSP430-Flash-Microcontrollers
This application repository describes the implementation of a bootloader that resides in the main memory of MSP430â„¢ flash-based microcontrollers (MCUs) using universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART). This Bootloader has a small footprint, which makes it a very cost-effective solution, and supports the large memory model (devices with a memory footprint greater than 64KB).
As you can see my repository contain all the files needed to establish a loopback communication between two MSP430 launchpads via the bootloader, rised in the host component, it also contain a code source to convert the output image of the application to .c file so as to work with when using the host code.
